            <h1>Personal Blog: My VIT Journey</h1>
            <h2 style="margin-top: -32px;">Jan 10th, 2025</h2>
            <p class="blog">Starting university was like stepping into a whole new world, filled with challenges,
                excitement, and opportunities. As a computer science major, I was eager to dive into the technical
                world and explore how innovation could shape the future. The first year was a mix of nerves
                and excitement. Meeting new people, navigating a packed schedule, and adjusting to the
                academic rigor were all part of the process. I joined various tech-related clubs and
                communities, which helped me meet like-minded peers and get inspired by others' projects and
                ideas. When I attended my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>, I walked in knowing almost nothing about building
                projects or coding under pressure, but I left with invaluable lessons learned from my peers.
                Despite my initial struggles, the supportive environment encouraged me to ask questions,
                experiment, and grow. The thrill of seeing ideas come to life during the hackathon sparked
                a deeper interest in applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems.

                Participating in <a href="https://www.un.org/en/mun">Model United Nations</a> challenged me to step outside my comfort
                zone. Debating on global issues, crafting arguments, and collaborating with delegates helped
                sharpen my communication and leadership skills. Each conference was a chance to develop
                diplomacy while forming bonds with amazing people. University events were also a highlight.
                From tech expos to cultural fests, attending these gatherings was a way to relax, recharge,
                and make lasting memories. They became moments that balanced the academic rigor and brought
                fun into campus life.<br><br>
                Football was my escape from long coding sessions. Whether playing with friends or
                supporting my favorite teams, it fueled my passion and kept me grounded. The camaraderie
                on the field taught me teamwork and discipline—skills I carried over to group projects and
                collaborations in my academic pursuits.

                Some of my most cherished memories involve the friendships I made. Meeting people from
                different backgrounds, sharing laughs during late-night study sessions, and navigating
                challenges together created bonds that went beyond just coursework. From exploring ideas
                during a hackathon to relaxing over a game of football, my university experience became
                a mix of challenges, victories, and unforgettable moments. It's a journey I'm proud to have
                taken—and one that has shaped me in more ways than I imagined.
