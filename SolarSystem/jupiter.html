        <br><br>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant
        with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly
        less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth, and a tenth
        that of the Sun. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
        Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial phase
        of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere
        consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior. Listed below are some details
