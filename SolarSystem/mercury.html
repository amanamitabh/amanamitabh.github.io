        <br><br>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the
        ancient Roman god Mercurius, god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury
        is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury
        is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Listed below
        are some details about Mercury:<br>
