        <br><br>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after
        Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. Even though Saturn
        is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter. Saturn's interior is
        thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen. The planet has
        a bright and extensive system of rings, composed mainly of ice particles,rocky debris and dust. At least
        146 moons orbit the planet. Listed below are some details about Saturn:<br>
