        <br><br>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in
        mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial
        planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. Venus may have
        had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment, before a runaway greenhouse
        effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into its present state. Listed below are some details about 
        Venus:<br>
