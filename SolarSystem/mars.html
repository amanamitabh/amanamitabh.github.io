        <br><br>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is
        covered in iron oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". Mars is among the brightest objects
        in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope
        viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets.
        Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos. Listed below
        are some details about Mars:<br>
