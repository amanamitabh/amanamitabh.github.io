        <br><br>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This
        is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.
        Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The
        remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses
        within Earth's land hemisphere. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact
        to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a
        magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation. Listed
        below are some details about Earth:<br>
