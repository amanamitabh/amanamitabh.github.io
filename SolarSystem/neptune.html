        <br><br>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest
        planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
        Compared to its fellow ice giant Uranus, Neptune is slightly more massive, but denser and smaller.
        Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was found
        from mathematical predictions derived from indirect observations rather than being initially observed.
        Listed below are some details about Neptune:<br>
